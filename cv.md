# **Anton Bystrov** \
Russia, Vologda

I am 32 years old. I am a road builder by profession. But leading a nomadic lifestyle, I had a chance to change a bunch of specialties. But they were all far from intellectual.
I have absolutely no experience in IT, but I have long dreamed of getting it. The only way out here is just to teach and practice. And here I am.\
It's not a secret for anyone that good specialists earn the corresponding money. And the coolest can do it from anywhere in the world. This is a very good motivation. But not the main one.\
I tried solving problems on third-party sites and I really liked it. Let that task take at least a day, but the joy of solving it, as if an intergalactic ship was built on an electric motor and endowed with artificial intelligence. In general, I am here for a long time.\
By this stage of training, I have mastered the method of touch typing in both Russian and English layouts.\
English is at a basic level, but every day I devote 30 minutes to it.
